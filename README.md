# UK Regional Inflation Map for December 2024 in the form of the 3D Barplot 

While computing UK December 2024 inflation for every region, I was thinking if it is possible to combine map and barplot visualisation functionality for my computations and came across amazing **rayshader** package. It offers great depth to produce 3D GIS visualisations and is easily combined with **ggplot2** objects. Anyway, if you would like to replicate my infaltion map in the form of the 3D barplot:

```
1. Download .geojson and .csv files
2. Run UK_CPI_3D.R file
```

# Figure (Output)

Interesting to note that Wales, West Midlands and Northern Ireland have their inflation figures quite above what is reported by the ONS CPI in Decemeber 2024 for the UK.
